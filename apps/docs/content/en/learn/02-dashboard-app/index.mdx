For this course, we'll build a financial dashboard that has:

*   A public home page.
*   A login page.
*   Dashboard pages that are protected by authentication.
*   The ability for users to add, edit, and delete invoices.

The dashboard will also have an accompanying database, which you'll set up in [a later chapter](/learn/dashboard-app/setting-up-your-database).

By the end of the course, you'll have the essential skills needed to start building full-stack Next.js applications.
