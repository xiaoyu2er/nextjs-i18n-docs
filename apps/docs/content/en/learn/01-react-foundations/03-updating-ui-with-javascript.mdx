In this chapter, we'll start building out our project by using JavaScript and DOM methods to add an `h1` tag to your project.

Open your code editor and create a new `index.html` file. Inside the HTML file, add the following code:

```html {1,2,3,4,5} filename="index.html"
<html>
  <body>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then give the `div` a unique `id` so that you can target it later.

```html {3} filename="index.html"
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

To write JavaScript inside your HTML file, add a `script` tag:

```html {4} filename="index.html"
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, inside the `script` tag, you can use a DOM method, [`getElementById()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById), to select the `<div>` element by its `id`:

```html {5} filename="index.html"
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

You can continue using DOM methods to create a new `<h1>` element:

```html {6,9,12,13,16,19} filename="index.html"
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      // Select the div element with 'app' id
      const app = document.getElementById('app');
 
      // Create a new H1 element
      const header = document.createElement('h1');
 
      // Create a new text node for the H1 element
      const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
      const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
 
      // Append the text to the H1 element
      header.appendChild(headerContent);
 
      // Place the H1 element inside the div
      app.appendChild(header);
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

To make sure everything is working, open your HTML file inside your browser of choice. You should see an `h1` tag that says, 'Develop. Preview. Ship.'.

[HTML vs. the DOM](#html-vs-the-dom)
------------------------------------

If you look at the DOM elements inside your [browser developer tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools), you will notice the DOM includes the `<h1>` element. The DOM of the page is different from the source code - or in other words, the original HTML file you created.

/>

This is because the HTML represents the **initial page content**, whereas the DOM represents the **updated page content** which was changed by the JavaScript code you wrote.

Updating the DOM with plain JavaScript is very powerful but verbose. You've written all this code to add an `<h1>` element with some text:

```html filename="index.html"
<script type="text/javascript">
  const app = document.getElementById('app');
  const header = document.createElement('h1');
  const text = 'Develop. Preview. Ship.';
  const headerContent = document.createTextNode(text);
  header.appendChild(headerContent);
  app.appendChild(header);
</script>
```

As the size of an app or team grows, it can become increasingly challenging to build applications this way.

With this approach, developers spend a lot of time writing instructions to tell the computer **how** it should do things. But wouldn't it be nice to describe **what** you want to show and let the computer figure out **how** to update the DOM?

[Imperative vs. declarative programming](#imperative-vs-declarative-programming)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The code above is a good example of **imperative** **programming.** You're writing the steps for **how** the user interface should be updated. But when it comes to building user interfaces, a declarative approach is often preferred because it can speed up the development process. Instead of having to write DOM methods, it would be helpful if developers were able to declare **what** they want to show (in this case, an `h1` tag with some text).

In other words, **imperative programming** is like giving a chef step-by-step instructions on how to make a pizza. **Declarative programming** is like ordering a pizza without being concerned about the steps it takes to make the pizza. 🍕

[React](https://react.dev/) is a popular declarative library that you can use build user interfaces.

[React: A declarative UI library](#react-a-declarative-ui-library)
------------------------------------------------------------------

As a developer, you can tell React what you want to happen to the user interface, and React will figure out the steps of **how** to update the DOM on your behalf.

In the next section, we'll explore how you can get started with React.
