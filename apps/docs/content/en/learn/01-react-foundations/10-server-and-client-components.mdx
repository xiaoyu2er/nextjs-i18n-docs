To understand how Server and Client Components work, it's helpful to be familiar with two foundational web concepts:

*   The [environments](#server-and-client-environments) your application code can be executed in: the server and the client.
*   The [network boundary](#network-boundary) that separates server and client code.

[Server and Client Environments](#server-and-client-environments)
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In the context of web applications:

*   The **client** refers to the browser on a userâ€™s device that sends a request to a server for your application code. It then turns the response it receives from the server into an interface the user can interact with.
*   The **server** refers to the computer in a data center that stores your application code, receives requests from a client, does some computation, and sends back an appropriate response.

Each environment has its own set of capabilities and constraints. For example, by moving rendering and data fetching to the server, you can reduce the amount of code sent to the client, which can improve your application's performance. But, as you learned earlier, to make your UI interactive, you need to update the DOM on the client.

Therefore, the code you write for the server and the client is not always the same. Certain operations (e.g. data fetching or managing user state) are better suited for one environment over the other.

[Network Boundary](#network-boundary)
-------------------------------------

The **Network Boundary** is a conceptual line that separates the different environments.

In React, you choose where to place the network boundary in your component tree. For example, you can fetch data and render a user's posts on the server (using Server Components), then render the interactive `LikeButton` for each post on the client (using Client Components).

Similarly, you can create a `Nav` component that is rendered on the server and shared across pages, but if you want to show an active state for links, you can render the list of `Links` on the client.

<Image

Behind the scenes, the components are split into two module graphs. The **server module graph (or tree)** contains all the Server Components that are rendered on the server, and the **client module graph (or tree)** contains all Client Components.

After Server Components are rendered, a special data format called the **React Server Component Payload (RSC)** is sent to the client. The RSC payload contains:

1.  The rendered result of Server Components.
2.  Placeholders (or holes) for where Client Components should be rendered and references to their JavaScript files.

React uses this information to consolidate the Server and Client Components and update the DOM on the client.

Let's see how this works.

[Using Client Components](#using-client-components)
---------------------------------------------------

As you learned in the last chapter, Next.js uses Server Components by default - this is to improve your application's performance and means you don't have to take additional steps to adopt them.

Looking back at the error in your browser, Next.js is warning you that you're trying to `useState` inside a Server Component. You can fix this by moving the interactive "Like" button to a Client Component.

Create a new file called `like-button.js` inside the `app` folder that exports a `LikeButton` component:

```js {1} filename="/app/like-button.js"
export default function LikeButton() {}
```

Move the `<button>` element and the `handleClick()` function from `page.js` to your new `LikeButton` component:

```js {2,3,4,6} filename="/app/like-button.js"
export default function LikeButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
  }
 
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;
}
```

Next, move the `likes` state and the import:

```js {1,4} filename="/app/like-button.js"
import { useState } from 'react';
 
export default function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
 
  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
  }
 
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;
}
```

Now, to make the `LikeButton` a Client Component, add the React `'use client'` directive at the top of the file. This tells React to render the component on the client.

```js {1} filename="/app/like-button.js"
'use client';
 
import { useState } from 'react';
 
export default function LikeButton() {
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0);
 
  function handleClick() {
    setLikes(likes + 1);
  }
 
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Like ({likes})</button>;
}
```

Back in your `page.js` file, import the `LikeButton` component into your page:

```js {1,18} filename="/app/page.js"
import LikeButton from './like-button';
 
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title ? title : 'Default title'}</h1>;
}
 
export default function HomePage() {
  const names = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Grace Hopper', 'Margaret Hamilton'];
 
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li key={name}>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      <LikeButton />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Save both files and view your app in the browser. Now that there are no errors, once you make changes and save, you should notice the browser automatically updates to reflect the change.

This feature is called [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh). It gives you instantaneous feedback on any edits you make and comes pre-configured with Next.js.

[Summary](#summary)
-------------------

To recap, you learned about the server and client environments and when to use each. You also learned that Next.js uses React Server Components by default to improve performance, and how you can opt into Client Components to smaller parts of your UI interactive.
