So far, if you were to reuse your `<Header />` component, it would display the same content both times.

```html {8,9} filename="index.html"
function Header() {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
```

But what if you want to pass different text or you don't know the information ahead of time because you're fetching data from an external source?

Regular HTML elements have attributes that you can use to pass pieces of information that change the behavior of those elements. For example, changing the `src` attribute of an `<img>` element changes the image that is shown. Changing the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag changes the destination of the link.

In the same way, you can pass pieces of information as properties to React components. These are called `props`. Take for instance, the possible variations of a button:

<Image
  alt="Diagram showing 3 variations of a button component: Primary, Secondary, and Disabled"
  srcLight="https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/light/learn-props.png"
  srcDark="https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/dark/learn-props.png"
  width="1600"
  height="286"
/>

Similar to a JavaScript function, you can design components that accept custom arguments (or props) that change the component's behavior or what is visibly shown when it's rendered to the screen. Then, you can pass down these props from parent components to child components.

> **Note:** In React, data flows down the component tree. This is referred to as _one-way data flow_. State, which will be discussed in the next chapter, can be passed from parent to child components as props.

[Using props](#using-props)
---------------------------

In your `HomePage` component, you can pass a custom `title` prop to the `Header` component, just like you'd pass HTML attributes:

```html {4} filename="index.html"
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="React" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

And `Header`, the child component, can accept those props as its first **function parameter**:

```html {1} filename="index.html"
function Header(props) {
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
```

If you `console.log()` props, you can see that it's an **object** with a title property.

```html {2} filename="index.html"
function Header(props) {
  console.log(props); // { title: "React" }
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
```

Since props is an object, you can use [**object destructuring**](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) to explicitly name the values of props inside your function parameters:

```html {1} filename="index.html"
function Header({ title }) {
  console.log(title); // "React"
  return <h1>Develop. Preview. Ship.</h1>;
}
```

Then you can replace the content of the `<h1>` tag with your title variable.

```html {3} filename="index.html"
function Header({ title }) {
  console.log(title);
  return <h1>title</h1>;
}
```

If you open your file in the browser, you will see that it is displaying the actual word "title". This is because React thinks you're intending to render a plain text string to the DOM.

You need a way to tell React that this is a JavaScript variable.

[Using variables in JSX](#using-variables-in-jsx)
-------------------------------------------------

To use the `title` prop, add **curly braces** `{}`. These are a special JSX syntax that allows you to write regular JavaScript directly inside your JSX markup.

```html {3} filename="index.html"
function Header({ title }) {
  console.log(title);
  return <h1>{title}</h1>;
}
```

You can think of curly braces as a way to enter "JavaScript land" while you are in "JSX land". You can add any **JavaScript expression** (something that evaluates to a single value) inside curly braces. For example:

1.  An **object property** with dot notation:

```js filename="example.js"
function Header(props) {
  return <h1>{props.title}</h1>;
}
```

2.  A **template literal**:

```js filename="example.js"
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{`Cool ${title}`}</h1>;
}
```

3.  The **returned value of a function**:

```js filename="example.js"
function createTitle(title) {
  if (title) {
    return title;
  } else {
    return 'Default title';
  }
}
 
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{createTitle(title)}</h1>;
}
```

4.  Or **ternary operators**:

```js filename="example.js"
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title ? title : 'Default Title'}</h1>;
}
```

You can now pass any string to your title prop, or, if you used the ternary operator, you could even not pass a title prop at all, since you've accounted for the default case in your component:

```js {2} filename="example.js"
function Header({ title }) {
  return <h1>{title ? title : 'Default title'}</h1>;
}
 
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Your component now accepts a generic title prop which you can reuse in different parts of your application. All you need to do is change the title string:

```html {4,5} filename="index.html"
function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="React" />
      <Header title="A new title" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

[Iterating through lists](#iterating-through-lists)
---------------------------------------------------

It's common to have data that you need to show as a list. You can use array methods to manipulate your data and generate UI elements that are identical in style but hold different pieces of information.

Add the following array of names to your `HomePage` component:

```html {2} filename="index.html"
function HomePage() {
  const names = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Grace Hopper', 'Margaret Hamilton'];
 
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You can then use the `array.map()` method to iterate over the array and use an **arrow function** to map a name to a list item:

```html {7,8,9,10,11} filename="index.html"
function HomePage() {
  const names = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Grace Hopper', 'Margaret Hamilton'];
 
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Notice how you've used curly braces to weave in and out of "JavaScript" and "JSX" land.

If you run this code, React will give us a warning about a missing `key` prop. This is because React needs something to uniquely identify items in an array so it knows which elements to update in the DOM.

You can use the names for now since they are currently unique, but it's recommended to use something guaranteed to be unique, like an item ID.

```html {9} filename="index.html"
function HomePage() {
  const names = ['Ada Lovelace', 'Grace Hopper', 'Margaret Hamilton'];
 
  return (
    <div>
      <Header title="Develop. Preview. Ship." />
      <ul>
        {names.map((name) => (
          <li key={name}>{name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
