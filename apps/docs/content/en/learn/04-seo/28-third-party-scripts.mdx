Many applications rely on third-party JavaScript to include different types of functionality, such as analytics, ads, and customer support widgets. However, embedding third-party authored code can delay page content from rendering and affect user performance if it is loaded too early.

Next.js provides a built-in [Script component](/docs/basic-features/script) that optimizes loading for any third-party script, while giving developers the option to decide when to fetch and execute it.

### [Using the Script Component](#using-the-script-component)

Using regular HTML, external scripts would need to be manually appended to `next/head`:

```
import Head from 'next/head';
 
function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <script src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=123" />
      </Head>
    </div>
  );
}
```

With the Next.js Script component, you can add it anywhere in the component without needing to use `next/head`:

```
import Script from 'next/script';
 
function IndexPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Script
        strategy="afterInteractive"
        src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=123"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

The Script component introduces a `strategy` property that allows you to decide when to fetch and execute a script for optimal loading. To not negatively affect Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), most third-party scripts should be deferred to load after all the contents of a page has finished loading, either immediately after the page becomes interactive (`strategy="afterInteractive"`) or lazily during browser idle time (`strategy="lazyOnload"`).
