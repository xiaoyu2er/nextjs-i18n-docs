In 2016, Google began giving [search ranking preference](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/about-amp) to web pages using [AMP](https://amp.dev/) – a technology that enables developers to create web pages that load faster on mobile devices – at the cost of building and maintaining them over time.

With the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) page experience update, Google [dropped AMP pages as a requirement](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/more-details-page-experience#details) to appear in search carousels. This is one of the last main benefits that Google had for AMP in terms of SEO purposes.

Since the introduction of AMP, newer technology, such as Next.js, has proven its ability to improve website experience without sacrificing Developer Experience (DX).

While Next.js offers [AMP support](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/amp-support/introduction), consider weighing the costs and benefits of having an AMP implementation in your website if it already has great Core Web Vitals scores.
