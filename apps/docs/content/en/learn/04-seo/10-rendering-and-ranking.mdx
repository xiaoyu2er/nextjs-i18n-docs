JavaScript is an important part of the web development ecosystem. In the past, most programming languages were sending all content directly from the server.

With technology like JavaScript, fetching information from the browser became more popular than ever. This, in turn, affected search engines and their ability to understand pages, as most bots were only parsing the initial HTML from the server and loading it to the browser.
