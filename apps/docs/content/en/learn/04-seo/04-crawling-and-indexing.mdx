In this lesson, we'll take a look at:

*   Metadata and what web crawlers look for when parsing web content.
*   How to communicate with Google so its search crawler knows when there is new content on your site.
*   How to leverage meta robot tags and canonical links to indicate to search engines your desired indexing status.
