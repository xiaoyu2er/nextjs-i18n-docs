[Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) is an initiative created by Google to provide unified guidance and metrics to measure end-user page experience on the web.

[Core Web Vitals](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/11/timing-for-page-experience) is a subset of Web Vitals, and currently consists of three metrics that measure loading, interactivity, and visual stability. These metrics are [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](/learn/seo/lcp), [First Input Delay (FID)](/learn/seo/fid), and [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](/learn/seo/cls).

Achieving a great score in these three metrics will create a smoother website experience for your users.
