In this lesson, we will reduce the amount of JavaScript loaded during initial page load from third-party libraries.

Next.js supports ES2020 [dynamic `import()`](/docs/advanced-features/dynamic-import) for JavaScript. With it, you can import JavaScript modules dynamically and work with them. They also work with server-side rendering (SSR).

Think of dynamic imports as another way to split your code into manageable chunks.

Open the `pages/index.js` file and remove these two imports at the beginning of the file as we are going to dynamically import them further down the file.

```
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';
import _ from 'lodash';
```

For now we also want to remove:

```
const fuse = new Fuse(countries, {
  keys: ['name'],
  threshold: 0.3,
});
```

Now that we have removed this code, let's set up the search input to use the dynamically imported libraries.

We can replace the input with the following code:

```
<input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Country search..."
  className={styles.input}
  onChange={async (e) => {
    const { value } = e.currentTarget;
    // Dynamically load libraries
    const Fuse = (await import('fuse.js')).default;
    const _ = (await import('lodash')).default;
 
    const fuse = new Fuse(countries, {
      keys: ['name'],
      threshold: 0.3,
    });
 
    const searchResult = fuse.search(value).map((result) => result.item);
 
    const updatedResults = searchResult.length ? searchResult : countries;
    setResults(updatedResults);
 
    // Fake analytics hit
    console.info({
      searchedAt: _.now(),
    });
  }}
/>
```

By using Dynamic Imports, this fixes the "Remove unused JavaScript" issue on page load. This also improves our Time to Interactive (TTI), which helps improve [First Input Delay (FID)](/learn/seo/fid).

Let's run another Lighthouse Report in Chrome DevTools to view our progress.
