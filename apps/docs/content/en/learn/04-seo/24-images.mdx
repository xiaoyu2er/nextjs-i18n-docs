### [Unoptimized Images](#unoptimized-images)

Using regular HTML, we have added our Hero image like so:

```
<img src="large-image.jpg" alt="Large Image" />
```

However, this means we have to manually optimize a few things like:

*   Ensuring our image is responsive on different screen sizes.
*   Optimizing our images with a third-party tool or library.
*   Lazy-loading images as they enter the viewport

### [The Image Component](#the-image-component)

Next provides a [Image component](/docs/api-reference/next/image) that can handle these optimizations out-of-the-box for us.

`next/image` is an extension of the HTML `img` element, evolved for the modern web.

This means that resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP (when the browser supports it) can be done automatically using `next/image`.

The component avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport and allows Next.js to adopt future image formats and serve those images to browsers that support them.

Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.

### [How does Automatic Image Optimization Work?](#how-does-automatic-image-optimization-work)

#### [On-demand Optimization](#on-demand-optimization)

Instead of optimizing images at build time, Next.js optimizes images on-demand as users request them. Unlike static site generators and static-only solutions, build times don't increase, whether shipping ten images or ten million images.

#### [Lazy Loaded Images](#lazy-loaded-images)

Images are lazy loaded by default. Page speed won't be penalized for images housed outside of the viewport. Images only load when they come into view.

#### [Avoids CLS](#avoids-cls)

Images are always rendered to avoid Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS).

### [Using the Image Component](#using-the-image-component)

Let's update the app using `next/image` to display our hero image. The height and width props should be the desired rendering size, with an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

Open the `pages/index.js` file and add an import for

`Image` from `next/image` at the beginning of the file:

```
import Image from 'next/image';
```

Then, replace the hero `img` with the `Image` component:

```
// Before
<img src="large-image.jpg" alt="Large Image" />
 
// After
<Image src="/large-image.jpg" alt="Large Image" width={3048} height={2024} />
```

There's also an image in the footer. Let's replace this as well:

```
// Before
<img src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" />
 
// After
<Image src="/vercel.svg" alt="Vercel Logo" width={72} height={16} />
```

Finally, run another Lighthouse report in Chrome DevTools and compare your results.
