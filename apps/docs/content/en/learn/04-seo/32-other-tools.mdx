You can find field data collection in the following tools:

*   [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/): Google's Page Speed measurement tool.
*   [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report): Field data open-source dataset.
*   [Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9205520): Google Search, Core Web Vitals report.

If you are looking for lab data, Google also offers several measurement tools:

*   [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse?hl=en): Google's open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages.
*   [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/): Set of web developer tools built directly into the Google Chrome browser.

Note that for both tools, you will need to use [Total Blocking Time (TBT)](https://web.dev/tbt/) as an alternative to [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/) since FID can only be measured through field data.
