URL Structure is an important part of an SEO strategy. While Google doesn't disclose which weight each part of SEO has, great URLs are considered a best practice no matter if they are a big or small ranking factor in the end.

You might want to follow some principles:

*   **Semantic**: It's best to use URLs that are semantic, meaning that they use words instead of IDs or random numbers. Example: [`/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app`](/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)is better than `/learn/course-1/lesson-1`
*   **Patterns that are logical and consistent**: URLs should follow some sort of pattern that is consistent among pages. For example, you want to have a folder that groups all product pages, instead of having different paths for each product that you have.
*   **Keyword focused**: Google still bases a considerable part of their systems on the keywords a website contains. You might want to use keywords in your URLs to facilitate understanding the purpose of the pages.
*   **Not parameter-based**: Using parameters to build your URLs is generally not a good idea. They are not semantic in most cases, and search engines might confuse them and demote their rankings in results.

### [How are Routes Defined in Next.js?](#how-are-routes-defined-in-nextjs)

Next.js uses [file-system routing](/docs/routing/introduction) built on the [file-system routing](/docs/routing/introduction) built on the concept of [pages](/docs/basic-features/pages). When a file is added to the `pages` directory, it is automatically available as a route. The files and folders inside the `pages` directory can be used to define most common patterns.

Let's take a look at a couple of simple URLs and how you would add them to your Next.js router:

*   **Homepage**: `https://www.example.com` → `pages/index.js`
*   **Listings**: `https://www.example.com/products` → `pages/products.js` or `pages/products/index.js`
*   **Detail**: `https://www.example.com/products/product` → `pages/products/product.js`

For a blog or e-commerce site you will likely want to use the product ID or blog name as the slug for the URL. This is called [**dynamic routing**](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes):

*   **Product:** `https://www.example.com/products/nextjs-shirt` → `pages/products/[product].js`
*   **Blog:** `https://www.example.com/blog/seo-in-nextjs` → `pages/blog/[blog-name].js`

To use dynamic routing, you can add brackets to a page name inside your `products` or `blogs` subfolder.

Here's an example of a page optimized for this using SSG:

```
// pages/blog/[slug].js
 
import Head from 'next/head';
 
export async function getStaticPaths() {
  // Call an external API endpoint to get posts
  const res = await fetch('https://www.example.com/api/posts');
  const posts = await res.json();
 
  // Get the paths we want to pre-render based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }));
  // Set fallback to blocking. Now any new post added post build will SSR
  // to ensure SEO. It will then be static for all subsequent requests
  return { paths, fallback: 'blocking' };
}
 
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://www.example.com/api/blog/${params.slug}`);
  const data = await res.json();
 
  return {
    props: {
      blog: data,
    },
  };
}
 
function BlogPost({ blog }) {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{blog.title} | My Site</title>
      </Head>
      <div>
        <h1>{blog.title}</h1>
        <p>{blog.text}</p>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}
 
export default BlogPost;
```

Here's another example using SSR:

```
// pages/blog/[slug].js
 
import Head from 'next/head';
function BlogPost({ blog }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Head>
        <title>{blog.title} | My Site</title>
      </Head>
      <div>
        <h1>{blog.title}</h1>
        <p>{blog.text}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
 
export async function getServerSideProps({ query }) {
  const res = await fetch(`https://www.example.com/api/blog/${query.slug}`);
  const data = await res.json();
 
  return {
    props: {
      blog: data,
    },
  };
}
 
export default BlogPost;
```
