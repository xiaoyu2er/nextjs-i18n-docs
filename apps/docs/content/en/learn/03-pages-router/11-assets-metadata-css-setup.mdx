**If you’re continuing from the previous lesson,** you can skip this page.

### [Download Starter Code (Optional)](#download-starter-code-optional)

If you’re NOT continuing from the previous lesson, you can download, install, and run the starter code for this lesson below. This sets up a `nextjs-blog` directory such that it’s identical to the result of the previous lesson.

Again, this is NOT necessary if you’ve just finished the previous lesson.

```
npx create-next-app nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/assets-metadata-css-starter"
```

Then follow the instructions from the command output (`cd` into the directory and start the development server).
