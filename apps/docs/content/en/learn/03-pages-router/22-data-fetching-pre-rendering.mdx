Before we talk about [data fetching](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching), let’s talk about one of the most important concepts in Next.js: [**Pre-rendering**](/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering).

By default, Next.js pre-renders every page. This means that Next.js _generates HTML for each page in advance_, instead of having it all done by client-side JavaScript. Pre-rendering can result in better performance and [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization).

Each generated HTML is associated with minimal JavaScript code necessary for that page. When a page is loaded by the browser, its JavaScript code runs and makes the page fully interactive. (This process is called **hydration**.)

### [Check That Pre-rendering Is Happening](#check-that-pre-rendering-is-happening)

You can check that pre-rendering is happening by taking the following steps:

1.  Disable JavaScript in your browser. ([Here’s how in Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/disable/)).
2.  [Try accessing this page](https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/) (the final result of this tutorial).

You should see that your app is rendered without JavaScript. That’s because Next.js has pre-rendered the app into static HTML, allowing you to see the app UI without running JavaScript.

> **Note**: You can also try the above steps on `localhost`, but CSS won’t be loaded if you disable JavaScript.

If your app is a plain React.js app (without Next.js), there’s no [pre-rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), so you won’t be able to see the app if you disable JavaScript. For example:

*   Enable JavaScript in your browser and [check out this page](https://create-react-template.vercel.app/). This is a plain React.js app built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
*   Now, disable JavaScript and access [the same page](https://create-react-template.vercel.app/) again.
*   You won’t see the app anymore — instead, it’ll say "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app." This is because the app is not pre-rendered into static HTML.

### [Summary: Pre-rendering vs. No Pre-rendering](#summary-pre-rendering-vs-no-pre-rendering)

Here’s a quick graphical summary:

Next, let’s talk about **two forms** of pre-rendering in Next.js.
