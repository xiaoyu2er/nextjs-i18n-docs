Before we deploy, let’s push our Next.js app to [GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) if you haven’t done so already. This will make deployment easier.

*   On your personal GitHub account, create a new repository called `nextjs-blog`.
*   The repository can be public or private. You do **not** need to initialize it with a README or other files.
*   If you need help setting up your repo, take a look at [this guide on GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo).

Then:

*   If you haven’t initialized the git repository locally for your Next.js app, do so now.
*   Push the Next.js app to your GitHub repository.

To push to GitHub, you can run the following commands (replace `<username>` with your GitHub username):

```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/nextjs-blog.git
git push -u origin main
```

Once your GitHub repository is ready, continue to the next page.
