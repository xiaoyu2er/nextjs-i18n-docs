We’ve populated the index page with the blog data, but we still haven’t created individual blog pages yet (here’s the [desired result](https://next-learn-starter.vercel.app/)). We want the URL for these pages to depend on the blog data, which means we need to use [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

### [What You’ll Learn in This Lesson](#what-youll-learn-in-this-lesson)

In this lesson, you’ll learn:

*   How to statically generate pages with [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes) using [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation).
*   How to write [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) to fetch the data for each blog post.
*   How to render markdown using [`remark`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark).
*   How to pretty-print date strings.
*   How to link to a page with [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
*   Some useful information on [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
