The second page we added currently does not have styling. Let's add some CSS to style the page.

Next.js has built-in support for [CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support). For this course, we will use CSS.

This lesson will also talk about how Next.js handles static assets like images and page metadata like the `<title>` tag.

### [What You’ll Learn in This Lesson](#what-youll-learn-in-this-lesson)

In this lesson, you’ll learn:

*   How to add [static files](/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving) (images, etc) to Next.js.
