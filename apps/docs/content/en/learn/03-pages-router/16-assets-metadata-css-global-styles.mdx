[CSS Modules](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) are useful for component-level styles. But if you want some CSS to be loaded by **every page**, Next.js has support for that as well.

To load [global CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) to your application, create a file called `pages/_app.js` with the following content:

```
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

The default export of `_app.js` is a top-level React component that wraps all the pages in your application. You can use this component to keep state when navigating between pages, or to add global styles as we're doing here. [Learn more about `_app.js` file](/docs/advanced-features/custom-app).

### [Restart the Development Server](#restart-the-development-server)

**Important:** You need to restart the development server when you add [`pages/_app.js`](/docs/advanced-features/custom-app). Press Ctrl + c to stop the server and run:

```
npm run dev
```

### [Adding Global CSS](#adding-global-css)

In Next.js, you can add [global CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) files by importing them from [`pages/_app.js`](/docs/advanced-features/custom-app). You **cannot** import global CSS anywhere else.

The reason that [global CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-a-global-stylesheet) can't be imported outside of `pages/_app.js` is that global CSS affects all elements on the page.

If you were to navigate from the homepage to the `/posts/first-post` page, global styles from the homepage would affect `/posts/first-post` unintentionally.

You can place the global CSS file anywhere and use any name. So let’s do the following:

*   Create a top-level `styles` directory and a `global.css` file.
*   Add the following CSS inside `styles/global.css`. This code resets some styles and changes the color of the `a` tag:

```
html,
body {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
  font-family:
    -apple-system,
    BlinkMacSystemFont,
    Segoe UI,
    Roboto,
    Oxygen,
    Ubuntu,
    Cantarell,
    Fira Sans,
    Droid Sans,
    Helvetica Neue,
    sans-serif;
  line-height: 1.6;
  font-size: 18px;
}
 
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
 
a {
  color: #0070f3;
  text-decoration: none;
}
 
a:hover {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
 
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
```

Finally, import the CSS file inside the `pages/_app.js` file you've created earlier on:

```
// `pages/_app.js`
import '../styles/global.css';
 
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}
```

Now, if you access [http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post), you’ll see that the styles are applied. Any styles imported in `_app.js` will be applied globally, to all pages of the application.

> **If it didn’t work**: Make sure you restart the development server when you update `pages/_app.js`.
