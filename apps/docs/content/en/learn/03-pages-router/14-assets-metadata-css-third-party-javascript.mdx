**Third-party JavaScript** refers to any scripts that are added from a third-party source. Usually, third-party scripts are included in order to introduce newer functionality into a site that does not need to be written from scratch, such as analytics, ads, and customer support widgets.

### [Adding Third-Party JavaScript](#adding-third-party-javascript)

Let's dive into how we can add a third-party script to a Next.js page.

Open `pages/posts/first-post.js` in your editor and find the following lines:

```
<Head>
  <title>First Post</title>
</Head>
```

In addition to metadata, scripts that need to load and execute as soon as possible are usually added within the `<head>` of a page. Using a regular HTML `<script>` element, an external script would be added as follows:

```
<Head>
  <title>First Post</title>
  <script src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js" />
</Head>
```

This script contains the [Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript/quickstart) which is commonly used to introduce Facebook social plugins and other functionality. Although this approach works, including scripts in this manner does not give a clear idea of when it would load with respect to the other JavaScript code fetched on the same page. If a particular script is render-blocking and can delay page content from loading, this can significantly impact performance.

### [Using the Script Component](#using-the-script-component)

[`next/script`](/docs/api-reference/next/script) is an extension of the HTML `<script>` element and optimizes when additional scripts are fetched and executed.

In the same file, add an import for `Script` from `next/script` at the beginning of the file:

```
import Script from 'next/script';
```

Now, update the `FirstPost` component to include the `Script` component:

```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>First Post</title>
      </Head>
      <Script
        src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js"
        strategy="lazyOnload"
        onLoad={() =>
          console.log(`script loaded correctly, window.FB has been populated`)
        }
      />
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">← Back to home</Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

Notice that a few additional properties have been defined in the Script component:

*   `strategy` controls when the third-party script should load. A value of `lazyOnload` tells Next.js to load this particular script lazily during browser idle time
*   `onLoad` is used to run any JavaScript code immediately after the script has finished loading. In this example, we log a message to the console that mentions that the script has loaded correctly

Try accessing [http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post). By using your browser’s developer tools, you should see the message above logged in the `Console` panel. In addition, you can run `window.FB` to see that the script has populated this global variable.

**Note:** The Facebook SDK was only used as a contrived example to show how to add third-party scripts to your application in a performant way. Now that you understand the basics of including third-party functionality in Next.js, you can remove the Script component from `FirstPost` before proceeding.
