The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the **[Vercel](https://vercel.com)** platform developed by the creators of Next.js.

Vercel is a serverless platform for static and hybrid applications built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database. We make it easy for frontend teams to develop, preview, and ship delightful user experiences, where performance is the default. You can start using it for free — no credit card required.

### [Create a Vercel Account](#create-a-vercel-account)

First, go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/signup) to create a Vercel account. Choose **Continue with GitHub** and go through the sign up process.

### [Import your `nextjs-blog` repository](#import-your-nextjs-blog-repository)

Once you’re signed up, **import** your `nextjs-blog` repository on Vercel. You can do so from here: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/import).

*   You’ll need to **Install Vercel for GitHub**. You can give it access to **All Repositories**.
*   Once you’ve installed Vercel, import `nextjs-blog`.

You can use _default values_ for the following settings — no need to change anything. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

*   Project Name
*   Root Directory
*   Build Command
*   Output Directory
*   Development Command

When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.

> **Help is available**: If your deployment fails, you can always get help on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions). To learn more about deployment, take a look at [our documentation](/docs/deployment).

When it’s done, you’ll get **deployment URLs**. Click on one of the URLs and you should see the Next.js starter page live.

Congratulations! You just deployed your Next.js app to production. On the next page, we’ll go into the details of Vercel and the recommended workflow.
