[API Routes](/docs/api-routes/introduction) let you create an API endpoint inside a Next.js app. You can do so by creating a **function** inside the `pages/api` directory that has the following format:

```
// req = HTTP incoming message, res = HTTP server response
export default function handler(req, res) {
  // ...
}
```

> Learn more about the request handler above in the [API Routes documentation](/docs/api-routes/introduction).

They can be deployed as Serverless Functions (also known as Lambdas).

### [Creating a simple API endpoint](#creating-a-simple-api-endpoint)

Let’s try it out. Create a file called `hello.js` in `pages/api` with the following code:

```
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ text: 'Hello' });
}
```

Try accessing it at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). You should see `{"text":"Hello"}`. Note that:

*   `req` is an instance of [http.IncomingMessage](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), plus some pre-built [middlewares](/docs/api-routes/api-middlewares).
*   `res` is an instance of [http.ServerResponse](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), plus some [helper functions](/docs/api-routes/response-helpers).

That’s it! Before we wrap up this lesson, let’s talk about some tips for using [API Routes](/docs/api-routes/introduction) on the next page.
