To build a complete web application with React from scratch, there are many important details you need to consider:

*   Code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.
*   You need to do production optimizations such as code splitting.
*   You might want to statically pre-render some pages for performance and SEO. You might also want to use server-side rendering or client-side rendering.
*   You might have to write some server-side code to connect your React app to your data store.

A _framework_ can solve these problems. But such a framework must have the right level of abstraction — otherwise it won’t be very useful. It also needs to have great "Developer Experience", ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

### [Next.js: The React Framework](#nextjs-the-react-framework)

Enter **Next.js**, the React Framework. Next.js provides a solution to all of the above problems. But more importantly, it puts you and your team in the [pit of success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) when building React applications.

Next.js aims to have best-in-class developer experience and many built-in features, such as:

*   An intuitive [page-based](/docs/basic-features/pages) routing system (with support for [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes))
*   [Pre-rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages#pre-rendering), both [static generation](/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended) (SSG) and [server-side rendering](/docs/basic-features/pages#server-side-rendering) (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
*   Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
*   [Client-side routing](/docs/routing/introduction#linking-between-pages) with optimized prefetching
*   [Built-in CSS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support) and [Sass support](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support), and support for any [CSS-in-JS](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#css-in-js) library
*   Development environment with [Fast Refresh](/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) support
*   [API routes](/docs/api-routes/introduction) to build API endpoints with Serverless Functions
*   Fully extendable

Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications, including many of the world's largest brands.

### [About This Tutorial](#about-this-tutorial)

This free interactive course will guide you through how to get started with Next.js.

In this tutorial, you’ll learn Next.js basics by creating a very simple **blog app**. Here’s an example of the final result:
