Let’s try editing the starter page.

*   Make sure the Next.js development server is still running.
*   Open `pages/index.js` with your text editor.
*   Find the text that says **"Welcome to"** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **"Learn"**.
*   Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically updates the page with the new text:

![Learn Next.js](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/pages-router/create-nextjs-app/learn-nextjs.png)

The Next.js development server has [Fast Refresh](/docs/basic-features/fast-refresh) enabled. When you make changes to files, Next.js automatically applies the changes in the browser almost instantly. No refresh needed! This will help you iterate on your app quickly.

Great job! That’s it for the first lesson.

In the next lesson, we’ll talk about _creating more pages and navigating between pages_.

> You should keep the development server running, but if you want to restart it, hit Ctrl + c to stop the server.
