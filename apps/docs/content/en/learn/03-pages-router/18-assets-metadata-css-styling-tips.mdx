### [Using `clsx` library to toggle classes](#using-clsx-library-to-toggle-classes)

[`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) is a simple library that lets you toggle class names easily. You can install it using `npm install clsx` or `yarn add clsx`.

Please take a look at its [documentation](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx) for more details, but here's the basic usage:

*   Suppose that you want to create an `Alert` component which accepts `type`, which can be `'success'` or `'error'`.
*   If it's `'success'`, you want the text color to be green. If it's `'error'`, you want the text color to be red.

You can first write a CSS module (e.g. `alert.module.css`) like this:

```
.success {
  color: green;
}
.error {
  color: red;
}
```

And use `clsx` like this:

```
import styles from './alert.module.css';
import { clsx } from 'clsx';
 
export default function Alert({ children, type }) {
  return (
    <div
      className={clsx({
        [styles.success]: type === 'success',
        [styles.error]: type === 'error',
      })}
    >
      {children}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### [Customizing PostCSS Config](#customizing-postcss-config)

Out of the box, with no configuration, Next.js compiles CSS using [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/).

To customize PostCSS config, you can create a top-level file called [`postcss.config.js`](/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config#customizing-plugins). This is useful if you're using libraries like [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Here are the steps to add [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). First, install the packages:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss autoprefixer postcss
```

Then, create a [`postcss.config.js`](/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config#customizing-plugins):

```
// postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

We also recommend [configuring content sources](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration) by specifying the `content` option on `tailwind.config.js`:

```
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    // For the best performance and to avoid false positives,
    // be as specific as possible with your content configuration.
  ],
};
```

### [Using Sass](#using-sass)

Out of the box, Next.js allows you to import [Sass](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#sass-support) using both the `.scss` and `.sass` extensions. You can use component-level Sass via [CSS Modules](/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support#adding-component-level-css) and the `.module.scss` or `.module.sass` extension.

Before you can use Next.js' built-in Sass support, be sure to install [`sass`](https://github.com/sass/sass):

```
npm install -D sass
```
