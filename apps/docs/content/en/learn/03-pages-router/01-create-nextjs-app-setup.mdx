First, let’s make sure that your development environment is ready.

*   If you don’t have **Node.js** installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/). You’ll need Node.js version **18** or higher.
*   You’ll be using your own text editor and terminal app for this tutorial.

> If you are on Windows, we recommend [downloading Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and use Git Bash that comes with it, which supports the UNIX-specific commands in this tutorial. [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is another option.

### [Create a Next.js app](#create-a-nextjs-app)

To create a Next.js app, open your terminal, `cd` into the directory you’d like to create the app in, and run the following command:

```
npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/learn-starter"
```

> Under the hood, this uses the tool called [`create-next-app`](/docs/api-reference/create-next-app), which bootstraps a Next.js app for you. It uses [this template](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/learn-starter) through the `--example` flag.
> 
> If it doesn’t work, please take a look at [this page](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/blob/main/basics/errors/install.md).

### [Run the development server](#run-the-development-server)

You now have a new directory called `nextjs-blog`. Let’s `cd` into it:

```
cd nextjs-blog
```

Then, run the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This starts your Next.js app’s "development server" (more on this later) on port **3000**.

Let’s check to see if it’s working. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) from your browser.
