Here is some essential information you should know about [dynamic routes](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).

### [Fetch External API or Query Database](#fetch-external-api-or-query-database)

Like [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation), [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) can fetch data from any data source. In our example, `getAllPostIds` (which is used by [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation)) may fetch from an external API endpoint:

```
export async function getAllPostIds() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..');
  const posts = await res.json();
  return posts.map((post) => {
    return {
      params: {
        id: post.id,
      },
    };
  });
}
```

### [Development vs. Production](#development-vs-production)

*   In **development** (`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`), [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) runs on _every request_.
*   In **production**, [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) runs at _build time_.

### [Fallback](#fallback)

Recall that we returned `fallback: false` from [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation). What does this mean?

If [`fallback` is `false`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-false), then any paths not returned by [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) will result in a **404 page**.

If [`fallback` is `true`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-true), then the behavior of [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) changes:

*   The paths returned from [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) will be rendered to HTML at build time.
*   The paths that have not been generated at build time will **not** result in a 404 page. Instead, Next.js will serve a "fallback" version of the page on the first request to such a path.
*   In the background, Next.js will statically generate the requested path. Subsequent requests to the same path will serve the generated page, just like other pages pre-rendered at build time.

If [`fallback` is `blocking`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#fallback-blocking), then new paths will be server-side rendered with `getStaticProps`, and cached for future requests so it only happens once per path.

This is beyond the scope of our lessons, but you can learn more about `fallback: true` and `fallback: 'blocking'` in the [`fallback` documentation](/docs/api-reference/data-fetching/get-static-paths#fallback-false).

### [Catch-all Routes](#catch-all-routes)

Dynamic routes can be extended to catch all paths by adding three dots (`...`) inside the brackets. For example:

*   `pages/posts/[...id].js` matches `/posts/a`, but also `/posts/a/b`, `/posts/a/b/c` and so on.

If you do this, in [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation), you must return an array as the value of the `id` key like so:

```
return [
  {
    params: {
      // Statically Generates /posts/a/b/c
      id: ['a', 'b', 'c'],
    },
  },
  //...
];
```

And `params.id` will be an array in [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation):

```
export async function getStaticProps({ params }) {
  // params.id will be like ['a', 'b', 'c']
}
```

Take a look at the [catch all routes documentation](/docs/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-routes) to learn more.

### [Router](#router)

If you want to access the Next.js router, you can do so by importing the [`useRouter`](/docs/api-reference/next/router#userouter) hook from [`next/router`](/docs/api-reference/next/router).

### [404 Pages](#404-pages)

To create a [custom 404 page](/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page#404-page), create `pages/404.js`. This file is statically generated at build time.

```
// pages/404.js
export default function Custom404() {
  return <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>;
}
```

Take a look at our [Error Pages](/docs/advanced-features/custom-error-page) documentation to learn more.

### [More Examples](#more-examples)

We have created several examples to illustrate [`getStaticProps`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticprops-static-generation) and [`getStaticPaths`](/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getstaticpaths-static-generation) — take a look at their source code to learn more:
