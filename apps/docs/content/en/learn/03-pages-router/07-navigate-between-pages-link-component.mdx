When linking between pages on websites, you use the `<a>` HTML tag.

In Next.js, you can use the `Link` Component [`next/link`](/docs/api-reference/next/link) to link between pages in your application. `<Link>` allows you to do client-side navigation and accepts [props](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link#:~:text=Link%20accepts%20the%20following%20props%3A) that give you better control over the navigation behavior.

### [Using `<Link>`](#using-link)

First, open `pages/index.js`, and import the `Link` component from [`next/link`](/docs/api-reference/next/link) by adding this line at the top:

```
import Link from 'next/link';
```

Then find the `h1` tag that looks like this:

```
<h1 className={styles.title}>
  Learn <a href="https://nextjs.org">Next.js!</a>
</h1>
```

And change it to:

```
<h1 className={styles.title}>
  Read <Link href="/posts/first-post">this page!</Link>
</h1>
```

Next, open `pages/posts/first-post.js` and replace its content with the following:

```
import Link from 'next/link';
 
export default function FirstPost() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>First Post</h1>
      <h2>
        <Link href="/">Back to home</Link>
      </h2>
    </>
  );
}
```

As you can see, the `Link` component is similar to using `<a>` tags, but instead of `<a href="…">`, you use `<Link href="…">`.

> **Note:** Before Next.js 12.2, it was required that the `Link` component wrapped an `<a>` tag, but [this is not required in versions 12.2 and above](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12-2#:~:text=next/link%20no%20longer%20requires%20manually%20adding%20%3Ca%3E%20as%20a%20child.%20You%20can%20now%20opt%20into%20this%20behavior%20in%20a%20backward%2Dcompatible%20way.).

Let’s check to see if it works. You should now have a link on each page, allowing you to go back and forth:
