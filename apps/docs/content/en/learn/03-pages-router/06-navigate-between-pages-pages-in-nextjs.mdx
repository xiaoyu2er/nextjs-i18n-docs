In Next.js, a page is a React Component exported from a file in the [`pages` directory](/docs/basic-features/pages).

Pages are associated with a route based on their **file name**. For example, in development:

*   `pages/index.js` is associated with the `/` route.
*   `pages/posts/first-post.js` is associated with the `/posts/first-post` route.

We already have the `pages/index.js` file, so letâ€™s create `pages/posts/first-post.js` to see how it works.

### [Create a New Page](#create-a-new-page)

Create the `posts` directory under `pages`.

Create a file called `first-post.js` inside the `posts` directory with the following content:

```
export default function FirstPost() {
  return <h1>First Post</h1>;
}
```

The component can have any name, but you must export it as a `default` export.

Now, make sure that the development server is running and visit [http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post](http://localhost:3000/posts/first-post). You should see the page:

![First Post](https://h8DxKfmAPhn8O0p3.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/learn/pages-router/navigate-between-pages/first-post.png)

This is how you can create different pages in Next.js.

Simply create a JS file under the [`pages` directory](/docs/basic-features/pages), and the path to the file becomes the URL path.

In a way, this is similar to building websites using HTML or PHP files. Instead of writing HTML you write JSX and use React Components.

Let's add a link to the newly added page so that we can navigate to it from the homepage.
