[3x Faster Refresh](#3x-faster-refresh)
---------------------------------------

Starting with [v9.4](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4), Next.js brought Facebook's [Fast Refresh](/docs/architecture/fast-refresh) into open-source for instantaneous feedback on edits made to your React components.

This means Next.js only updates code in the file you edited, and only re-renders that component, without losing component state. This includes styles (inline, CSS-in-JS, or CSS/Sass Modules), markup, event handlers, and effects (via `useEffect`).

Today, we're making it **200ms faster** on every edit **without any code changes on your side**. On average, this makes Fast Refresh 3x faster.

Want even faster performance and better build times? Opt-in to Webpack 5 today with a new `future` flag.This flag is a release candidate (RC) and Webpack 5 will become the default soon. After you've enabled this flag, please [share any feedback with us](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/23498).

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  future: {
    webpack5: true,
  },
};
```

To learn more about how Webpack 5 is being rolled out to your application in a backward-compatible way, check out [the documentation](/docs/messages/webpack5).

[Improved Installation Time](#improved-installation-time)
---------------------------------------------------------

We've optimized Next.js' dependency graph to decrease install time and dependency size. It's now faster than ever to create a Next.js project, both locally and in your CI/CD process.

|  | 10.0 | 10.1 | delta |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Average installation time | ~15s | ~5s | 3.0x faster |
| Installation size | 96.5MB | 39.9MB | 58% smaller |
| Number of dependencies | 424 | 187 | 56% smaller |

As part of our goal to optimize dependencies, we also updated and/or replaced npm packages that were marked as deprecated by their authors – even when they were deeply nested in the dependency tree. A fresh install of Next.js 10.1 will now result in no package warnings.

[`next/image` Improvements](#nextimage-improvements)
----------------------------------------------------

### [Apple Silicon Support](#apple-silicon-support)

When [Next.js 10](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-10) was released, Image Optimization was powered by a native dependency. This led to a slower installation time, with native dependencies consuming 50% of Next.js' total install size. Further, this removes post-install running scripts and causing on-demand compilation.

We're excited to share Automatic Image Optimization through `next/image` is now powered by [WebAssembly](https://web.dev/squoosh-v2/). This optimization works out of the box using `next dev` and `next start`. By using WASM, we've reduced install size by ~30MB and **added support for [Apple Silicon](https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/) M1 MacBooks**.

We're continuing to improve our WebAssembly performance by taking advantage of [SIMD](https://v8.dev/features/simd) extensions and multi-threading.

#### [Additional Layouts](#additional-layouts)

Based on your feedback, we've added a variety of new layouts and options for `next/image`:

*   `layout=fill`: You don't need to provide `width` and `height`. ([Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fill))
*   `layout=fixed`: Native `img` behavior. ([Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-fixed))
*   `layout=responsive`: Flexible width with fixed aspect ratio. ([Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-responsive))
*   `layout=intrinsic`: Won't grow, but can shrink with fixed aspect ratio. ([Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/layout-intrinsic))
*   `objectFit=cover`: Background images. ([Demo](https://image-component.nextjs.gallery/background))

For more information, check out the [`layout` documentation](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#layout).

#### [Improved Image Optimization Support](#improved-image-optimization-support)

We've expanded on the [built-in image loaders](/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/images#loader) for `next/image` with the ability to add any custom loader. By using the new `loader` prop, you can **optimize images with any provider or CDN**.

```js filename="components/my-image.js"
import Image from 'next/image';
 
const myLoader = ({ src, width, quality }) => {
  return `https://example.com/${src}?w=${width}&q=${quality || 75}`;
};
 
const MyImage = (props) => {
  return (
    <Image
      loader={myLoader}
      src="/me.png"
      alt="Picture of the author"
      width={500}
      height={500}
    />
  );
};
```

For more information, check out the [`next/image` documentation](/docs/pages/api-reference/components/image#loader).

[Next.js Commerce Shopify Integration](#nextjs-commerce-shopify-integration)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

E-commerce is one of the fastest-growing industries adopting Next.js. Companies like Apple, Wal-Mart, McDonald's, and Nike trust Next.js.

We wanted to give you a high-performance starting point for building e-commerce applications, so we released [Next.js Commerce](https://nextjs.org/commerce). After thousands of requests for Shopify, we've updated Next.js Commerce with a **provider-agnostic UI** — enabling you to bring any headless e-commerce solution of your choice.

Switching between providers is a [single-line change](https://github.com/vercel/commerce#configuration) in your configuration. We've also created a Features API, allowing you to toggle functionality based on your use case – all while retaining best-in-class performance.

Lighthouse metrics for Next.js Commerce around the globe.

With a few clicks, Next.js developers can clone, deploy, and fully customize their own e-commerce store. Learn more at [nextjs.org/commerce](http://nextjs.org/commerce) and try out our [Shopify Demo](https://shopify.demo.vercel.store/). Support for more commerce providers is coming soon.

[Custom 500 Page](#custom-500-page)
-----------------------------------

You can now create a custom `pages/500.js` to add your own logo and branding when displaying errors. Similar to `pages/404.js`, this file is statically generated at build time.

```js filename="pages/500.js"
export default function Custom500() {
  return <h1>500 - Server-side error occurred</h1>;
}
```

[Strict PostCSS Configuration Loading](#strict-postcss-configuration-loading)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're using PostCSS and Webpack 5, you can improve performance (through caching) with a new `future` flag.

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  future: {
    webpack5: true,
    strictPostcssConfiguration: true,
  },
};
```

Try it out today and let us know your feedback. For more information, check out the [PostCSS Config documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/post-css).

[Support for `extends` in `tsconfig.json`](#support-for-extends-in-tsconfigjson)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now use `extends` in the `tsconfig.json` used by Next.js to extend from a different `tsconfig.json` in your project. For example, you can extend from a `tsconfig.base.json` in your project as follows:

```json filename="tsconfig.json"
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.base.json"
}
```

For more information, check out the [TypeScript documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/typescript).

[Detect When Preview Mode Is Enabled](#detect-when-preview-mode-is-enabled)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can now detect when Preview Mode is enabled, allowing you to render certain components only for editors.

```js filename="components/MyComponent.js"
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
 
function MyComponent() {
  const { isPreview } = useRouter();
  return <>{isPreview ? <h1>Preview Mode Enabled</h1> : null}</>;
}
```

For more information, check out the [Preview Mode documentation](/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/preview-mode).

[Router Methods Scroll to Top](#router-methods-scroll-to-top)
-------------------------------------------------------------

When navigating using `next/link`, Next.js will automatically scroll to the top. With Next.js 10.1 `router.push` and `router.replace` will also automatically scroll to the top to match the `next/link` behavior. You can opt-out of the automatic scrolling using the `scroll` option.

For more information, check out the [`next/router` documentation](/docs/pages/api-reference/functions/use-router).

[Documentation Improvements](#documentation-improvements)
---------------------------------------------------------

We've also added a variety of new guides, resources, and documentation, including:

*   [Incrementally Adopting Next.js](/docs/migrating/incremental-adoption)
*   [Migrating from Gatsby](/docs/migrating/from-gatsby)
*   [Migrating from Create React App](/docs/app/building-your-application/upgrading/from-create-react-app)
*   [Migrating from React Router](/docs/migrating/from-react-router)
*   [Authentication](/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/authenticating)
*   [Deploying with Docker](/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying#docker-image)
