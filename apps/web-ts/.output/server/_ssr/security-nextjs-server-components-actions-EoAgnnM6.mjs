			"heading": "http-apis",
			"content": "If you're adopting Server Components in an existing project, the recommended approach is to handle Server Components at runtime as unsafe/untrusted by default like SSR or within the client. So there is no assumption of an internal network or zones of trust and engineers can apply the concept of Zero Trust. Instead, you only call custom API endpoints such as REST or GraphQL using `fetch()` from Server Components just like if it was executing on the client. Passing along any cookies."

			"content": "Our recommended approach for new projects is to create a separate Data Access Layer inside your JavaScript codebase and consolidate all data access in there. This approach ensures consistent data access and reducing the chance of authorization bugs occurring. It's also easier to maintain given you're consolidating into a single library. Possibly providing better team cohesion with a single programming language. You also get to take advantage of better performance with lower runtime overhead, the ability to share an in-memory cache across different parts of a request."
		},
		{
			"heading": "data-access-layer",
			"content": "You build an internal JavaScript library that provides custom data access checks before giving it to the caller. Similar to HTTP endpoints but in the same memory model. Every API should accept the current user and check if the user can see this data before returning it. The principle is that a Server Component function body should only see data that the current user issuing the request is authorized to have access to."

		},
		{
			"heading": "component-level-data-access",
			"content": "In this approach you'll want to audit your `\"use client\"` files carefully. While auditing and reviewing PRs, look at all the exported functions and if the type signature accepts overly broad objects like `User`, or contains props like `token` or `creditCard`. Even privacy sensitive fields like `phoneNumber` need extra scrutiny. A Client Component should not accept more data than the minimal data it needs to perform its job."

It should not gain access to any privileged data or private APIs. It's highly discouraged to use hacks to try to circumvent this protection (such as stashing data on the global object). The principle is that this code should be able to execute the same on the server as the client. In alignment with secure by default practices, Next.js will fail the build if `server-only` modules are imported from a Client Component."

They should not be trusted and needs to be re-verified each time they are read. E.g. a searchParam should not be used to track things like `?isAdmin=true`. Just because the user is on `/[team]/` doesn't mean that they have access to that team, that needs to be verified when reading data. The principle is to always re-read access control and `cookies()` whenever reading data. Don't pass it as props or params."
		},
		{

These have to explicitly opt-in to accepting GET requests. There's no catch-all handler that might accidentally receive GET requests. If you do decide to create a custom GET handler, these might need extra auditing."

		},
		{
			"heading": "write",

			"content": "The snapshot of the closure must be sent to the client and back when the server is invoked."
		},
		{
			"heading": "closures",
			"content": "In Next.js 14, the closed over variables are encrypted with the action ID before sent to the client. By default a private key is generated automatically during the build of a Next.js project. Each rebuild generates a new private key which means that each Server Action can only be invoked for a specific build. You might want to use Skew Protection to ensure that you always invoke the correction version during redeploys."

			"content": "By encrypting all closed over variables, you don't accidentally expose any secrets in them. By signing it, it makes it harder for an attacker to mess with the input to the action."
		},
		{
			"heading": "closures",

			"content": "The principle is that the argument list to Server Actions (`\"use server\"`) must always be treated as hostile and the input has to be verified."

		{
			"heading": "csrf",
			"content": "All Server Actions can be invoked by plain `<form>`, which could open them up to CSRF attacks. Behind the scenes, Server Actions are always implemented using POST and only this HTTP method is allowed to invoke them. This alone prevents most CSRF vulnerabilities in modern browsers, particularly due to Same-Site cookies being the default."
		},
		{
			"heading": "csrf",
			"content": "As an additional protection Server Actions in Next.js 14 also compares the `Origin` header to the `Host` header (or `X-Forwarded-Host`). If they don't match, the Action will be rejected. In other words, Server Actions can only be invoked on the same host as the page that hosts it. Very old unsupported and outdated browsers that don't support the `Origin` header could be at risk."

			"heading": "error-handling",
			"content": "Bugs happen. When errors are thrown on the Server they are eventually rethrown in Client code to be handled in the UI. The error messages and stack traces might end up containing sensitive information. E.g. `[credit card number] is not a valid phone number`."
		},
		{
			"heading": "error-handling",
			"content": "In production mode, React doesn't emit errors or rejected promises to the client. Instead a hash is sent representing the error. This hash can be used to associate multiple of the same errors together and associate the error with server logs. React replaces the error message with its own generic one."
		},

		},
		{
			"heading": "custom-routes-and-middleware",
			"content": "Middleware can be used to limit access to certain pages. Usually it's best to do this with an allow list rather than a deny list. That's because it can be tricky to know all the different ways there is to get access to data, such as if there's a rewrite or client request."
		},
		{
			"heading": "custom-routes-and-middleware",

		},
		{
			"heading": "custom-routes-and-middleware",
			"content": "To make writing matchers easier Next.js App Router always uses the page's plain URL for both initial HTML, client navigations and Server Actions. Client navigations use `?_rsc=...` search param as a cache breaker."
		},
		{
			"heading": "custom-routes-and-middleware",
			"content": "Server Actions live on the page they're used on and as such inherit the same access control. If Middleware allows reading a page, you can also invoke actions on that page. To limit access to Server Actions on a page, you can ban the POST HTTP method on that page."
